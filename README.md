# PPO-Based Environment
Creating an environment based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm involves using reinforcement learning libraries like OpenAI Gym and Stable Baselines. This is a more advanced topic, and the implementation would depend on your specific requirements and the structure of your traffic simulation.

If you want to integrate PPO with your traffic simulation, you'll need to:

Define the observation space, action space, and reward function for your environment.
Use a reinforcement learning library (e.g., Stable Baselines) to train a PPO agent on your environment.
Implement a training loop to update the policy of the agent based on the rewards received.
